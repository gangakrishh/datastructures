- Give an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a BST

- Give an alogorithm for counting the number of BST's possible with n nodes

- Give an algorithm to check whether the given binary tree is a BST or not

- Give an algorithm for converting BST to cicular DLL with space complexity O(1)
  * hint: Convert Left n Right sub trees to DLLs and maintain end of those lists, then, adjust the pointers. TC O(n)

- Given a sorted doubly linked list, give an algorithm for converting it into balanced binary search tree.
	* hint find the list lenth and construct the tree bottom-up
	Tc : 2T(n/2) + O(n) = O(nlogn)

- Give a sorted array, give an algorithm for converting the array to BST

- Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

-Give an algorithm for finding the k-th smallest element in BST
  * hint : inorder traversal

- Give an algorithm for finding the union and intersection of BSTs. Assume parent pointers are available (say threaded binary trees). Also assume the lengths of two BST's are m and n respectively

- Given a BST and two numbers K1 and K2, give an algorithm for printing all the elements of BST in the range k1 and k2.

- Given root of binary search tree, trim the tree, so that all elements in the new tree returned are between the A and B

- Given two BSTs, check whether the elements of them are same or not. for example: TWO bsts with data 10, 5, 20,15,30 and 10 20 15 30 5 should return true, and data with 10,5,20,15,30 and 10 15 30 20 5

- Given a height h, give an algorithm for generating the HB(0).
