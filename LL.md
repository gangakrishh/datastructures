- Implement Stack using Linked List

- find nth node from the end of a list

- check whether the given linked list is either null terminated or ends in a cycle

- insert node in a sorted list

- reverse a singly linked list

- suppose there are two singly linked lists both of which intersect at some point and become a single linked list. The head or start pointers of both the list are known, but the intersecting node is not known. Also, the number of nodes in each of the list before they intersect are unknown and both list may have it different. List1 may have n nodes before it reaches intersection point and List2 might have m nodes before it reaches intersection

- How will you find the middle of the linked list

- How will you display a linked list from the end

- check whether the given linked list length is even or odd

- if the head of a linked list is pointing to kth element then how will you get the elements before kth element

- Given two sorted linked list, we need to merge them into the third list in sorted order

- Reverse the linked list in pairs, if you have a linked list that holds 1-->2-->3-->4--->x, then after the function has been called the linked list would hold 2-->1-->4-->3-->x

- Given a binary tree convert it to doubly linked list

- how do we sort the linked lists

- if we want to concatenate two linked lists which of the following gives 0(1) complexity --- circular doubly linked list

- split a circular linked lists into two equal parts. if the number of nodes in the list are odd then make first list one node extra than second list.

- how will you check if the linked list is palindrome or not

- exchange the adjacent elements in a linkedlist.

- is it possible to get 0(1) access time for linked lists

- Josephus circle: N people have decided to elect a leader by arranging themselves in a circle and eleminating every Mth person around the circle, closing ranks as each person drops out. Find which person will be the last one remaining (which rank 1).


- for a given k value (k>0) reverse blocks of k nodes in a list
