- if we want to register beans based some logic @Profile is not sufficent.

- to provide much more flexibility for registring spring beans conditionally, spring 4 introduced the conecept of @Conditional
  * A specific class is present in classpath
  * A spring bean of certain type doesn't already registered in ApplicationContext.
  * A spring file exists on a location
  * A specific property value is configured in a configuration file
  * A specific system property is present/absent
